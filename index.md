# Hello!

Graduated from National University of Malaysia, major in Computer Science.

Currently living in Tangerang, Indonesia. Main interests are games, technology, and digital trends.

Knowledge is important, appearance is a plus, what is matter is inside your brain. Hit me up if you want to grab some drinks, I'd love to hear your story.
